Inline::Guile version 0.001
===========================

An Inline module for the GNU Guile Scheme interpreter.

This module allows you to add blocks of Scheme code to your Perl
scripts and modules.  Any procedures you define in your Scheme code
will be available in Perl.

For information about handling Guile data in Perl see the Guile.pm
docs.  This module is mostly a wrapper around Guile::eval_str() with a
little auto-binding magic for procedures.

For details about the Inline interface, see the Inline docs.


DEPENDENCIES
